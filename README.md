# Semantic-based-question-answering-system.

Idea: Suppose any outsider visits a classroom and he wants to know details of each student,so it will really easy if we can build a prototype where we can have all details and he will ask questions and answer will be generated. However, the speech to text generation part is not covered here,we will assume that that we have raw text as a question. 
                        Thus,our task is to build an ontology for student-classroom system for storing information of n number of students like names,personal details,courses enrolled, interest, hobbies etc. and generating queries related to it using SPARQL. 

Solution : Ontology will be created in Protege software where we can generate queries too using SPARQL. Using NLP techniques for parsing,lemmatizing etc for generated query using python language and outputing it. By proper construction of class, object and sub-class we can increase the efficiency of query.
